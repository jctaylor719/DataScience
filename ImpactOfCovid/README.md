# Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Minority Populations

## Abstract

The purpose of this research was to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 cases in the United States and minorities within its population. Using data from The COVID Tracking Project, the study aimed to further test data related to the cases and deaths of racial/ethnic minorities within the United States. Linear regression models conducted on the data revealed that some minority groups experienced more cases and less deaths, and other minority groups experienced less cases and more deaths. However, when combined, it remained true that minorities, overall, fell victim to more cases and deaths than their population percentage, and whites experienced less.


## Introduction

One study found the existence of a racial/ethnic disparity was likely for almost every state within the United States (Racial). However, it is not clear how these disparities affect every minority individually. The goal of this study is to reveal a more detailed look into the disparities in COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths; the study will show how concentrated or dispersed these disparities are among different groups.

## Methods

In this study, there were multiple linear regression models to examine COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths. After establishing the groups to examine— white/Caucasian, black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian— the regression lines could be created. A regression line needed to be created that represented minorities, as well as multiple regression lines to represent each minority individually. By studying the variations of the regression lines between each minority, the way each minority suffers from COVID-19 will be revealed.

## Results

Analysis of the linear regression models in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 indicated that there was a larger ‘gap’, or disparity, between whites and minorities when it came to COVID-19 cases than it did for COVID-19 related deaths. The red line represents the mean population of the white community, and the black line represents the mean population of the selected minorities— black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian— combined.
