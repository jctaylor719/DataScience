# Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Minority Populations

## Abstract

The purpose of this research was to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 cases in the United States and minorities within its population. Using data from The COVID Tracking Project, the study aimed to further test data related to the cases and deaths of racial/ethnic minorities within the United States. Linear regression models conducted on the data revealed that some minority groups experienced more cases and less deaths, and other minority groups experienced less cases and more deaths. However, when combined, it remained true that minorities, overall, fell victim to more cases and deaths than their population percentage, and whites experienced less.
